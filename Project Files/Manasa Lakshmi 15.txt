Saving the Model
1. Save the entire model (architecture + weights + optimizer state)
python
Copy
Edit
model.save('grainpalette_model.h5')
print("Model saved as grainpalette_model.h5")
This saves the model in HDF5 format (.h5), which is widely supported.

2. Alternatively, save in TensorFlow's SavedModel format (recommended)
python
Copy
Edit
model.save('grainpalette_saved_model')
print("Model saved in TensorFlow SavedModel format at 'grainpalette_saved_model/'")
This creates a folder with the full model â€” better for deployment and future use.

Loading the Saved Model
From .h5 file
python
Copy
Edit
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

model = load_model('grainpalette_model.h5')
From SavedModel folder
python
Copy
Edit
model = load_model('grainpalette_saved_model')
